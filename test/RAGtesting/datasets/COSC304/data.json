      "expectedAnswer": "To implement order.jsp and store an order with its products, you need to validate the customer id, insert the order, and save each product in the order. Here is a code snippet demonstrating this functionality:\n\n```jsp\n<%@ page import=\"java.sql.*\" %>\n<%@ page import=\"java.util.*\" %>\n<%\nString customerId = request.getParameter(\"customerId\");\nList<String> cart = (List<String>) session.getAttribute(\"cart\");\nConnection conn = null;\nPreparedStatement pstmtOrder = null;\nPreparedStatement pstmtProduct = null;\nResultSet rs = null;\ntry {\n    Class.forName(\"com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver\");\n    String dbURL = \"jdbc:sqlserver://cosc304_sqlserver:1433;DatabaseName=orders;TrustServerCertificate=True\";\n    conn = DriverManager.getConnection(dbURL, \"username\", \"password\");\n    // Validate customer id\n    String sqlCustomer = \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers WHERE customer_id = ?\";\n    pstmtOrder = conn.prepareStatement(sqlCustomer);\n    pstmtOrder.setInt(1, Integer.parseInt(customerId));\n    rs = pstmtOrder.executeQuery();\n    rs.next();\n    if (rs.getInt(1) == 0) {\n        out.println(\"Invalid customer id\");\n        return;\n    }\n    // Insert order\n    String sqlInsertOrder = \"INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, order_date) VALUES (?, GETDATE())\";\n    pstmtOrder = conn.prepareStatement(sqlInsertOrder, Statement.RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS);\n    pstmtOrder.setInt(1, Integer.parseInt(customerId));\n    pstmtOrder.executeUpdate();\n    rs = pstmtOrder.getGeneratedKeys();\n    rs.next();\n    int orderId = rs.getInt(1);\n    // Insert order products\n    String sqlInsertProduct = \"INSERT INTO order_products (order_id, product_id) VALUES (?, ?)\";\n    pstmtProduct = conn.prepareStatement(sqlInsertProduct);\n    for (String productId : cart) {\n        pstmtProduct.setInt(1, orderId);\n        pstmtProduct.setInt(2, Integer.parseInt(productId));\n        pstmtProduct.executeUpdate();\n    }\n    out.println(\"Order placed successfully with Order ID: \" + orderId);\n    // Clear cart\n    session.setAttribute(\"cart\", new ArrayList<String>());\n} catch (Exception e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n} finally {\n    if (rs != null) try { rs.close(); } catch (SQLException ignore) {}\n    if (pstmtOrder != null) try { pstmtOrder.close(); } catch (SQLException ignore) {}\n    if (pstmtProduct != null) try { pstmtProduct.close(); } catch (SQLException ignore) {}\n    if (conn != null) try { conn.close(); } catch (SQLException ignore) {}\n}\n%>\n```",
