      "question": "For A8 Q2, the sumCol method sums the elements in a specified column of a 2D array. How should the method handle invalid column indices that are out of bounds for the given array?",
      "expectedAnswer": "The sumCol method should check if the given column index is within the valid range of columns for the array. If the index is out of bounds, the method should throw an IndexOutOfBoundsException or return a default value like 0.",

      "question": "For A8 Q3, the assignment requires using a 2D array for a capitals quiz. Should the program ignore case sensitivity when comparing user input to the correct answers?",
      "expectedAnswer": "Yes, the program should ignore case sensitivity when comparing user input to the correct answers. This can be done by converting both the user input and the correct answer to the same case (e.g., lower case) before comparison.",

      "expectedAnswer": "The getters for the dimensions (l, w, h) should return the actual values stored in the object. Since these are primitive types (double), returning the value directly is safe.",

      "question": "For A9 Q2, when creating the BankAccount class, should the withdraw and deposit methods handle cases where the amount to be withdrawn or deposited is negative?",
      "expectedAnswer": "Yes, the withdraw and deposit methods should handle cases where the amount is negative. Ideally, these methods should throw an IllegalArgumentException if a negative amount is provided.",

      "question": "For A9 Q2, the assignment specifies a static count attribute to track the number of BankAccount objects created. Should this count be incremented in both constructors, and how should we ensure thread safety?",
      "expectedAnswer": "Yes, the count should be incremented in both constructors. To ensure thread safety, the increment operation should be synchronized or use an atomic variable to prevent race conditions.",

      "expectedAnswer": "The number 0 should not be included in the even count, and it should not affect the sum and average calculations. The program should ignore 0 when counting and calculating the sum and average of the entered values.",

      "question": "For A5 Q2, the assignment requires us to find perfect numbers between 1 and 10,000. Should we use a specific algorithm to find the sum of divisors, and how do we ensure the program runs efficiently given the range?",
      "expectedAnswer": "You should use a loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 10,000 and for each number, find its divisors by iterating up to half of that number (since a divisor cannot be greater than half the number). To ensure efficiency, store the sum of divisors in a variable and check if it equals the original number to determine if it is perfect.",
