This is known as the closure of X under F.\n\nThe algorithm involves:\n\n1. **Starting with a set of attributes X**: Begin with a set of attributes X.\n2. **Setting X+ = X**: Initialize X+ to contain only the attributes in X.\n3. **Iterating through the process**:\n\t* **Find a functional dependency (FD) in F where the left side is a subset of X+**: Look for an FD in F where the left side (the \""if\"" part) is a subset of the current X+.\n\t* **Add the right side of F to X+**: Add the right side (the \""then\"" part) of the found FD to X+.\n4. **Continuing this process until X+ no longer changes**: Repeat steps 3a and 3b until no new attributes can be added to X+, i.e., X+ remains unchanged after an iteration.\n\n**Example:**\n\nLet's use the example provided in the context:\n\nWe have a relation R(A, B, C, D, E, G) with functional dependencies (FDs):\n\n* A \u2192 B, C\n* C \u2192 D\n* D \u2192 G\n\nTo compute the attribute closure for X = {A}, we follow the algorithm:\n\n1.

This will make it easier to read and maintain.\n\n2. **Handle multiple types of exceptions**: Currently, your code only catches `InputMismatchException`. You should also catch other potential exceptions, such as `ArithmeticException` for division by zero.\n\n3. **Provide more informative error messages**: Instead of just printing \""Invalid input. Please try again.\"", provide more specific error messages to help the user understand what went wrong.\n\n4. **Use a more robust way to clear invalid inputs**: Instead of using `scanner.nextLine()` to clear the invalid input, use `scanner.next()` and check if it returns a valid input.
