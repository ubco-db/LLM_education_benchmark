Chatbot Response: {'question': 'For A5 Q2, the assignment requires us to find perfect numbers between 1 and 10,000. Should we use a specific algorithm to find the sum of divisors, and how do we ensure the program runs efficiently given the range?', 'answer': "I'm not sure, but this is what I think.\n\nTo find perfect numbers between 1 and 10,000, you can use a simple algorithm that calculates the sum of divisors for each number in the range. To ensure efficiency, you can optimize the algorithm by only checking up to the square root of the number for divisors, as any divisor larger than that would have a corresponding smaller divisor.\n\nFor example, you could use a nested loop structure where the outer loop iterates from 1 to 10,000, and the inner loop checks for divisors up to the square root of the current number. If the sum of divisors equals the number, it's a perfect number.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure about the specific implementation details or any potential optimizations that could be made.", 'questionId': '961f719c-bbd0-4a19-add5-5d17a7f75d78', 'sourceDocuments': [{'content': 'A5 (30 marks) \nFocus: loops (while, do-while, for) , String and Character classes \nQ1.
